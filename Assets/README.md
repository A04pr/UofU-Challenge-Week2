This is a portfolio website utilizing css and html. 

The page has primarily been built using flex, flex-box, and flex properties. 

There is a navigation bar to take you to different parts of the page, a short about me, a map of the projects i've worked on which will, upon clicking the image of the project, take you to the github page, and a contact info bar at the bottom.
